# Objection under GDPR (EN)

**Subject:** Objection to the processing of my personal data for AI training purposes and direct marketing pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR

## Dear Sir or Madam,

I hereby object to the processing of my personal data for the purposes of training artificial intelligence pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, particularly insofar as this processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest).

The use of personal data for training AI systems leads to a structural loss of control over its use. It is not foreseeable in which contexts the data will be further processed in trained models and what content will be generated from it. In particular, there is a risk that AI models will permanently generate inaccurate or personality-violating content – such as false information about criminally relevant incidents or other defamatory statements – that cannot be subsequently corrected. This represents a significant and unjustifiable endangerment of my personality rights.

I therefore request that you refrain from any further processing of my personal data for these purposes, especially based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Furthermore, I expressly object to the processing of my personal data for direct marketing purposes pursuant to Art. 21(2) GDPR.

For identification purposes, I am willing, if necessary, to accept a confirmation code or another form of verification at this email address. I request that you use exclusively this email address for further communication and not demand web forms or other alternative contact methods. I point out that the GDPR does not provide for an obligation to use such channels.

If my personal data has already been used for training AI systems, I request that you provide me with information about this pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, in particular regarding:
- the purpose
- the categories of data concerned
- any recipients, and
- the retention period or criteria for determining it

I set you a deadline of **7 days** from receipt of this email to confirm receipt of my objection by email and to inform me of the further procedure. Should I not receive a response within this period, I reserve the right to file a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority.

In the event that my objection is not complied with and damage results from this, I reserve the right to assert claims for damages pursuant to Art. 82 GDPR.

Yours sincerely,

Michaela Muster
