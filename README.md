## We Object to the Training of Your New AI Model With Our Personal Data!

Meta, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, X and other tech giants train their AI models on your personal data.

E.g. Meta wants to traing on your data if you don't object until 27th of May 2025 (https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/making-ai-work-harder-for-europeans/)

They base this on GDPR Article 6(1)(f) "legitimate interest", although this is not a valid legal basis for most cases of AI-training. Despite this legal boundary, they are proceeding anyway, betting that most people won't object. Once your data is absorbed into their models, it's too lateâ€”the damage is done and cannot be undone.

### Why You Must Act Now
- **Prevention is the Only Solution**: After your data trains their models, almost no technical solution exists to remove its influence
- **They're Betting on Your Silence**: These companies are deliberately moving forward, counting on mass inaction
- **Your Rights Are Being Trampled**: The fundamental right to control your personal data is being systematically violated
- **Billion-Dollar Profit from Your Personal Life**: Your intimate posts, photos, and communications become corporate assets without compensation
- **Permanent Digital Shadow**: AI systems will forever contain and potentially misuse traces of your personal information

### Our Position
**We object because we are not objects.**

We are subjects with enforceable data subject rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the GDPR.

### Your Data, Your Choice
The law is on your side, but you better your rights to maintain control of your digital identity.
